## 📄 About

This supplement was designed to accompany a manuscript evaluating Nivolumab + Relatlimab (NIVO+RELA) vs. Dabrafenib + Trametinib (DAB+TRAM) using MAIC methodology. It provides a high-level, illustrative overview of the process, including:

- Digitized Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves and survival table reconstruction  
- Simulated individual patient data (IPD)  
- Step-by-step reconstruction code  
- A schematic figure summarizing the workflow  

> **Note**: All data in this repository are **simulated** and do **not** reflect actual patient-level data or trial results. This resource is intended for educational and illustrative purposes only.
